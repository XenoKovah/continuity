# Wireshark Dissectors for Apple's BLE Continuity Protocol

- [Updated Dissector for Curent Stable Release 3.2.6](https://github.com/furiousMAC/continuity/tree/master/dissector/3.2.6)
- [Updated Dissector for Current Old Stable Release 3.0.13](https://github.com/furiousMAC/continuity/tree/master/dissector/3.0.13)


### Latest Dissector Versions

Version [3.2.6](https://github.com/furiousMAC/continuity/tree/master/dissector/3.2.6) (Stable Release as of Aug 12, 2020) and Version [3.0.13](https://github.com/furiousMAC/continuity/tree/master/dissector/3.0.13) (Old Stable Release as of Aug 12, 2020) are currently the most up-to-date dissectors for Apple's BLE Continuity Protocol. All of the changes since the initial Shmoocon release of the dissector can be seen in the [change log](https://github.com/furiousMAC/continuity/blob/master/dissector/CHANGELOG.md). All of the fields are also enumerated in the [fields](https://github.com/furiousMAC/continuity/blob/master/dissector/FIELDS.md) file. We currently do not have Windows installers for these newest set of changes. These two versions are also backwards compatible with previous releases of Wireshark 3.x.x (assuming you use previous Stable releases and Old Stable releases respectively). For example, you can use the [3.2.6](https://github.com/furiousMAC/continuity/tree/master/dissector/3.2.6) with any Wireshark version > 3.2.0 . You can use [3.0.13](https://github.com/furiousMAC/continuity/tree/master/dissector/3.0.13) with any Wireshark version > 3.0.0.

### Older Dissector Versions.

Version [3.2.1](https://github.com/furiousMAC/continuity/tree/master/dissector/3.2.1) and Version [3.0.8](https://github.com/furiousMAC/continuity/tree/master/dissector/3.0.8) contain Windows installers, but are based off of the original dissector that we released at Shmoocon in January 2020. This means that all of the changes outlined in the [change log](https://github.com/furiousMAC/continuity/blob/master/dissector/CHANGELOG.md) have not been added to these versions and should not be used.
